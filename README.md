# SignalEventDetection
Various signal measurements requires to detect and parametrize event in it. Mostly the threshold detection is widely used, which is sufficient method to event detection. But for better event parametrization the more precise event start within signal sometimes is needed. Thus the Retegate.SignalEventDetection has been developed.
